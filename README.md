# MyWins
First and simple version of MyWins app. This app makes saving your successes easier.  
It includes things like:  
  
-CardView  
-Material Design  
-Expandable FAB  
-Circular Reveal(I connected it with FAB)  
-Shared Element Transition(really cool animation)  
-Pop-up windows  
-RecyclerView  
-Butterknife  
-and so on...   

This app works, although it was my the first bigger app. It can be done better.
For example I haven't used patterns, injections, tests. I should use less intents and more fragments.
There are many things that I'm not happy about so I decided to refactor and improve it.  
  
And that's why I created MyWins2 repository!
  
  It's main branch contains better version of this repository
and test branch includes my the most up-to-date changes. I recommend you to switch to this branch immediately:
